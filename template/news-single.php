                            <strong>The Excellent Success</strong><br><br>
                            “Amidst successes, there were failures too, like my ill-fated venture into the flower shop business. Yet, each endeavour, successful or not, enriched me with invaluable experience. Among the successes, launching a mixed-use project in Phuket, overcoming the challenge of a tsunami, stands out. Another highlight was the opening of Rosewood Luang Prabang, which weathered the storm of COVID-19, supporting staff through innovative initiatives during the closure period. What fills me with the utmost pride, however, is how we cared for our staff during the toughest times, and their loyalty upon our reopening despite tempting offers from competitors. It's a testament to compassion, empathy, and loyalty. In reflection, I'm proud of every achievement and failure, making it impossible to single out one proudest moment” she says. <br><br>
                            “The values instilled by my Chinese-Thai parents - hard work, patience, perseverance, integrity, loyalty, authenticity, humility, and leadership - laid the groundwork. My education in Singapore instilled discipline, self- motivation, competitiveness, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. Every business accomplishment, I must admit, fills me with pride. They were forged through an incredible amount of dedication and sacrifice - countless hours of strategic planning, hard graft, teamwork, innovation, and overcoming numerous obstacles to reach our goals. For me, the journey was as enriching and meaningful as the destination” she adds.

                            <strong>Plans for the Future</strong><br><br>
                            In the previous year, she embarked on a venture into the mineral water industry. “It all began when we acquired land for an onsen hotel and decided to test the water's purity and mineral content. The results were nothing short of remarkable. To validate our findings, we sent samples to three different laboratories in Germany, Switzerland, and Australia, and each confirmed the same outcome. Deep beneath the surface, approximately 200 meters down (equivalent to the height of an 80-story building), we unearthed a pristine source of mineral water boasting an alkalinity of 8.8 pH, along with an exceptionally high total dissolved solids (TDS) count and a rich array of 16 minerals, including six rare trace minerals known for their health benefits, a rarity among mineral water brands. This discovery presented an irresistible opportunity, perfectly aligning with our plans for the hotel and residential development. Thus, in September of 2023, we proudly launched our new mineral water brand into the market-6ty degrees. The name pays homage to the source's temperature, which stands at a constant 60 degrees Celsius. However, as a newcomer in a fiercely competitive industry dominated by well- established giants with substantial resources, the venture carries significant risks. Yet,
                            I envision 6ty degrees becoming the 'Evian' of Asia. Currently, there is a glaring absence of an Asian contender in the international mineral water arena. That's precisely where I foresee us in the years to come. With consumers increasingly prioritizing sustainability, minimizing carbon footprints, and preserving natural resources, the demand for locally sourced mineral water is on the rise. This presents an opportunity for us to fulfil not just a market needs but also a global environmental imperative.”

                            Throughout her business endeavours, she has consistently adhered to three fundamental principles that guide the actions: benefiting society, inspiring others, and continuously striving for improvement. While she remains actively involved in their enterprises, she recognizes the weighty responsibility of nurturing, educating, and motivating the team at every level to embrace these same values. Moreover, she aims to instill in them even grander visions and aspirations for the future. <br><br>
